    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>  Jason Brown

      I am a recent graduate from the University of Toledo class of 2016 school of Engineering with a degree in
      Computer Science and Engineering Technology. I am a self starter and willing to learn new technologies as
      they become available. During school the main focus for langauages were C++/Java. I am teaching myself c#
      Android, Swift, and other languages to further my knowledge.

      <p>
        In this section I will go over a few of the hobbies that I like to do beside program on my free time. <br><br>
        Some of my hobbies include programming and learning new languages in my free time as I look for a job with the Computer Science
        and Information Technology field. I also love to bowl and golf with family. We have a family and friends league for both
        bowling and golf. Golf is Spring / Summer only and every Friday night at Green Oaks Golf course in Ypsilanti. Bowling is 3/4 of
        the year starting in late August / early September and goes every other Saturday night.
